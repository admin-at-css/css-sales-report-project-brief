# Technical Challenges - Why This Project is Complex

**Purpose of this document:** Explain why this is NOT a basic CRUD app and help you estimate effort accurately.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TL;DR - This is NOT a Basic CRUD App

If you're thinking "it's just forms + database", **think again**.

**Key Complexity Factors:**
1. üî¥ **Offline-first architecture** (not just "add SQLite")
2. üî¥ **31 Row-Level Security policies** (strict data isolation)
3. üî¥ **Background sync with conflict resolution** (not trivial)
4. üî¥ **Per-photo upload status tracking** (robust error handling)
5. üî¥ **Clean Architecture + BLoC** (strict code organization)
6. üî¥ **Test coverage requirements** (>60% overall, >80% business logic)

---

## üß© Challenge #1: Offline-First Architecture

### What It Means

**NOT** "just add SQLite as cache"

**YES** "complete local-first system with sync strategy"

### Technical Requirements

**Local Database (Drift/SQLite):**
- ‚úÖ All 8 tables replicated locally
- ‚úÖ Full CRUD operations work offline
- ‚úÖ Draft auto-save every 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Query performance (pagination 20 items/page)
- ‚úÖ Data persistence across app restarts

**Sync Queue:**
- ‚úÖ Transaction log for all local changes
- ‚úÖ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Per-record sync status tracking
- ‚úÖ Rollback capability if sync fails
- ‚úÖ Handle network interruptions gracefully

**Conflict Resolution:**
- ‚úÖ Last-Write-Wins for MVP (automatic)
- ‚úÖ Timestamp comparison (`updated_at` field)
- ‚úÖ Handle edge cases (edit while syncing, etc)

### Why It's Hard

1. **State Management Complexity**
   - Need to track: local state, sync status, network status
   - BLoC pattern required untuk manage complex state

2. **Edge Cases Galore**
   - What if user edits while offline, then online sync fails?
   - What if user creates record offline, then another user creates same record online?
   - What if photo upload succeeds but metadata sync fails?
   - What if app crashes mid-sync?

3. **Testing Difficulty**
   - Need to simulate offline/online transitions
   - Need to test all edge cases
   - Integration tests are critical

### Estimated Effort

- **Basic CRUD with SQLite:** 2-3 days
- **Proper offline-first with sync:** 2-3 weeks

**10x complexity difference.**

## üîê Challenge #2: Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

### What It Means

**31 RLS policies** di Supabase untuk ensure strict data isolation.

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Sales Rep A cannot see Sales Rep B's data (companies, contacts, projects, reports)
- ‚úÖ Manager can see ALL team data (read-only)
- ‚úÖ Users can only edit their own records
- ‚úÖ RLS policies must be tested **before** development

### Technical Requirements

**Supabase RLS Policies (8 tables √ó ~4 policies each):**
```sql
-- Example: Reports table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own reports"
  ON reports FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = created_by);

CREATE POLICY "Managers can view all reports"
  ON reports FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users
      WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
      AND users.role = 'manager'
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own reports"
  ON reports FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = created_by);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own reports"
  ON reports FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = created_by);
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Create 2 test users (sales rep A & B)
- ‚úÖ Verify sales rep A cannot see B's data
- ‚úÖ Verify manager can see both A & B's data
- ‚úÖ Test all CRUD operations per role
- ‚úÖ Test edge cases (shared contacts, etc)

### Why It's Hard

1. **SQL Complexity**
   - RLS policies use PostgreSQL functions
   - Need to understand `auth.uid()`, `EXISTS`, subqueries
   - Policy debugging is not straightforward

2. **Testing Overhead**
   - Cannot just "test in production"
   - Need dedicated test environment
   - Must test with multiple user accounts

3. **Integration with Local DB**
   - Local Drift DB does NOT enforce RLS
   - Client-side filtering required
   - Potential for data leakage if implemented wrong

### Estimated Effort

- **Basic CRUD (no RLS):** 1 week
- **With RLS policies + testing:** 2-3 weeks

**2-3x complexity difference.**

## üì∏ Challenge #3: Photo Upload Management

### What It Means

**NOT** just "upload file to storage"

**YES** "robust multi-photo upload with individual status tracking"

### Technical Requirements

**Per-Photo Status Tracking:**
- ‚úÖ Each photo has status: `pending`, `uploading`, `success`, `failed`
- ‚úÖ Retry failed uploads (max 3 attempts)
- ‚úÖ Show progress per photo (not just "uploading...")
- ‚úÖ Continue other photos if one fails (don't block)
- ‚úÖ Compression before upload (<500KB per photo)

**Sync Logic:**
```dart
Future<void> uploadReportPhotos(String reportId, List<Photo> photos) async {
  await Future.wait(
    photos.map((photo) async {
      try {
        // Mark as uploading
        await db.updatePhotoStatus(photo.id, 'uploading');

        // Compress
        final compressed = await compress(photo);

        // Upload to Supabase Storage
        await supabase.storage.uploadBinary(compressed);

        // Mark as success
        await db.updatePhotoStatus(photo.id, 'success');
      } catch (e) {
        // Mark as failed
        await db.updatePhotoStatus(photo.id, 'failed');
        await db.incrementRetryCount(photo.id);
      }
    }),
    eagerError: false, // Don't stop if one fails
  );
}
```

**UI Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Show upload progress per photo
- ‚úÖ Allow retry failed photos
- ‚úÖ Gracefully handle network errors
- ‚úÖ Work offline (queue for later)

### Why It's Hard

1. **Error Handling Complexity**
   - Network can fail mid-upload
   - Storage might be full
   - File might be corrupted
   - Need to handle ALL edge cases

2. **UX Considerations**
   - User might close app while uploading
   - Need background upload service
   - Show clear status to user

3. **Storage Management**
   - Need to cleanup failed uploads
   - Handle large files (compression required)
   - Supabase storage limits

### Estimated Effort

- **Basic photo upload:** 2-3 days
- **Robust with status tracking + retry:** 1-2 weeks

**5x complexity difference.**

## üèóÔ∏è Challenge #4: Clean Architecture + BLoC

### What It Means

**NOT** "put all code in one file"

**YES** "strict 3-layer separation with dependency injection"

### Required Structure

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                         # Shared utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error/                    # Exceptions & failures
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usecases/                 # Base UseCase interface
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ network/                  # Network connectivity check
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                 # Models, datasources, repo impl
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/               # Entities, repo interfaces, usecases
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/         # BLoC, pages, widgets
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ companies/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contacts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sync/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart
```

**Dependency Rule:**
```
Presentation ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Domain
```
- Presentation can import Data & Domain
- Data can import Domain only
- Domain imports NOTHING (pure Dart)

### Why It's Hard

1. **Learning Curve**
   - If you've never done Clean Architecture, steep learning curve
   - BLoC pattern has boilerplate

2. **More Files**
   - Simple feature = 10+ files (entity, model, repo interface, repo impl, usecase, bloc, page, widgets)
   - Folder structure must be consistent

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Each layer needs separate tests
   - Mocking dependencies required
   - Test coverage >60% overall, >80% business logic

### Estimated Effort

- **Basic MVC structure:** 1 week for all features
- **Clean Architecture + BLoC:** 3-4 weeks for all features

**3-4x complexity difference.**

---

## ‚úÖ Challenge #5: Code Quality Standards

### Requirements

**Flutter Analyze:**
- ‚úÖ `flutter analyze` must be 100% clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- ‚úÖ No ignored warnings/lints

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for all BLoCs (>80%)
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for all UseCases (>80%)
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for all Repositories (>80%)
- ‚úÖ Widget tests for key UI components
- ‚úÖ Integration tests for critical flows
- ‚úÖ Overall coverage >60%

**Code Review:**
- ‚úÖ Functions <20 lines where possible
- ‚úÖ Clear variable/function names
- ‚úÖ No code duplication
- ‚úÖ Dartdoc comments on public APIs
- ‚úÖ No `TODO` comments in committed code

### Why It's Hard

1. **Time Investment**
   - Writing tests takes time (sometimes 2x implementation time)
   - Maintaining clean code requires discipline

2. **Skill Required**
   - Need to know how to write good tests
   - Need to understand mocking, dependency injection

### Estimated Effort

- **No tests, basic code:** 10 weeks
- **With tests + clean code:** 12-14 weeks

**20% time overhead.**

## üìä Complexity Comparison

| Feature | Basic CRUD App | This Project | Multiplier |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Database** | 1 table, no relations | 8 tables, 31 RLS policies | 8x |
| **Offline** | Not required | Full offline-first + sync | 10x |
| **Photo Upload** | Basic upload | Per-photo status + retry | 5x |
| **Architecture** | Any structure | Clean Arch + BLoC | 3x |
| **Testing** | Optional | >60% coverage required | 2x |
| **Code Quality** | "Works" is enough | `flutter analyze` clean | 1.5x |

**Overall Complexity:** This project is **20-30x more complex** than a basic CRUD app.

---

## üí° What This Means for Your Estimate

### If You've Only Built Basic CRUD Apps

**Your initial estimate is probably 3-5x too low.**

**Example:**
- You think: "8 tables √ó 3 days = 24 days = Rp 4 juta"
- Reality: "Offline-first + RLS + sync + tests = 12 weeks = Rp 18 juta"

**Advice:** Be honest about your experience level. If you've never done offline-first, say so and price accordingly (include learning time).

### If You've Built Offline-First Apps Before

**You're in a good position, but don't underestimate:**
- 31 RLS policies need careful testing
- Clean Architecture adds structure overhead
- Photo management with status tracking is non-trivial

**Advice:** Reference your past projects. Show you understand the complexity.

### Red Flags in Proposals

- ‚ùå "4 juta cukup untuk semua, 3 minggu selesai"
- ‚ùå No mention of offline-first complexity
- ‚ùå No mention of RLS testing strategy
- ‚ùå Generic estimate without per-Epic breakdown

### Good Proposals

- ‚úÖ "4 juta cukup untuk Epic 1-3 (Authentication + Companies + Contacts), estimated 3-4 weeks"
- ‚úÖ "Full MVP (79 points) realistic budget adalah Rp 16 juta, 11 weeks, breakdown terlampir"
- ‚úÖ Mentions specific challenges: "RLS testing akan saya lakukan dengan 2 test users..."

---

## üîó Next Steps

After understanding technical challenges:
1. ‚úÖ Read **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md** - See the 31 RLS policies
2. ‚úÖ Read **SYNC_STRATEGY.md** - Understand offline-first sync logic
3. ‚úÖ Read **USER_STORIES.md** - Full requirements with edge cases
4. ‚úÖ Read **HOW_TO_PROPOSE.md** - Guide untuk calculate realistic budget
5. ‚úÖ Fill Google Form with honest, detailed proposal

---

**Remember:** Underpromising & overdelivering >> Overpromising & underdelivering.

We'd rather hear "I can only do 40 points with Rp 4M" than "I can do all 79 points" and then see poor quality or missed deadline.

**Good luck! üöÄ**
